# Cats vs Dogs!

In Cats vs Dogs, you play as a tiny little cat whose main goal is to explore the world. Unfortunately, the dogs keep getting in the way of your special vacation. Traverse all kinds of terrain, including lush forests, snowy mountain ranges, dry deserts, and even alien planets!

## Gameplay

### Instructions:

Left Arrow Key: Move left

Right Arrow Key: Move right

Space: Jump

### Scoring/Playing:

You can score points for collecting fish in each level. While the look of the fish may change, ***each fish is only worth 20 points.***

While playing, avoid touching the dogs, as they will make you lose health. ***If you lose three health, you lose one life. You start with three lives.*** Basically you have nine lives. Fitting for a cat.
